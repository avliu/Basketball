Project for University at Buffalo Men's Basketball Team

-- OBJECTIVE --
The objective of this project is to pull some statistics regarding the University at Buffalo’s Men’s basketball team by scraping our team website’s play-by-play log (example: http://www.ubbulls.com/sports/mbkb/2018-19/boxscores/20181218_fsn3.xml?view=plays). In particular, we are interested in rebounding percentage- a statistic that measures your rebounds as a percentage of the amount of rebounding opportunities you’re given over the course of multiple games. We are interested in this metric for both all players on the team, as well as all lineups used over the course of the season. The results are contained in the "FINAL_REPORT..." files.

-- PROJECT PARTS --
1. "basketball_details" describes the motivation from the basketball team for each statistic calculated in this project
2. "programming_details" contains descriptions of the coding implementation, design considerations, and runtime analysis
3. "code" contains Python script and C++ programs
4. "sample_scraped_game_data" is an example of the Python-scraped play-by-play log for one game (please view in raw format)
5. "OUTPUT..." files are what the program writes automatically
6. "FINAL_REPORT..." files are the final reports that are sent to the coach
