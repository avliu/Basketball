Project for University at Buffalo Men's Basketball Team

-- OBJECTIVE --
The objective of this project is to pull some statistics regarding the University at Buffalo’s Men’s basketball team by scraping our team website’s play-by-play log (example: http://www.ubbulls.com/sports/mbkb/2018-19/boxscores/20181218_fsn3.xml?view=plays). In particular, we are interested in rebounding percentage- a statistic that measures your rebounds as a percentage of the amount of rebounding opportunities you’re given (whereas traditional stats just give you your total number of rebounds).
