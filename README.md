Project for University at Buffalo Men's Basketball Team

-- OBJECTIVE --
The objective of this project is to pull some statistics regarding the University at Buffalo’s Men’s basketball team by scraping our team website’s play-by-play log (example: http://www.ubbulls.com/sports/mbkb/2018-19/boxscores/20181218_fsn3.xml?view=plays). In particular, we are interested in rebounding percentage- a statistic that measures your rebounds as a percentage of the amount of rebounding opportunities you’re given over the course of multiple games.

-- PROJECT PARTS --
1. "programming_details" contains descriptions of the coding implementation, design considerations, and runtime analysis
2. "basketball_details" describes the motivation from the basketball team for each statistic calculated in this project
3. "code" contains Python script and C++ programs
4. "sample_scraped_game_data" is an example of the Python-scraped play-by-play log for one game
5. "OUTPUT..." files are what the program writes automatically
6. "FINAL_REPORT..." files are the final reports that are sent to the coach. They focus on the 9 most used lineups
